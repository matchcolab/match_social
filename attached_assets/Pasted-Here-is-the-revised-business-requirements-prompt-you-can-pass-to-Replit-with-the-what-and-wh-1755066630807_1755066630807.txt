## Prompt for Replit: Match Colab – Onboarding & Data Gathering Flow

### Purpose

We want to design an onboarding experience that ensures new users understand our community, feel safe, and are guided toward creating a meaningful profile that allows them to participate in activities, become verified, and, if they wish, purchase a subscription for introductions. This flow must balance ease of entry with enough information to ensure quality and trust within the platform.

---

### **Core Principles**

1. **Safety & Trust** – We onboard only real people who are serious about finding a life partner.
2. **Progressive Commitment** – Reduce friction at signup, but encourage deeper profile completion before unlocking key features.
3. **Transparency** – Clearly explain what each step is for and how their information is used.
4. **Participation Gating** – Users must complete a *short social profile* to join activities, a *comprehensive profile* for verification and subscription eligibility, and hold a paid subscription to request introductions.
5. **Unique Identification** – No pseudonyms; each account is assigned a unique slug called an **App ID**.

### **Onboarding Journey**

#### **Step 1 – Minimal Account Setup**

* User provides essential contact details (email or phone) and verifies via OTP.
* Consent is collected for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines.
* The system assigns the user a **unique App ID** for internal and community identification.
* Purpose: Quickly create a secure account and start tracking the onboarding journey.

---

#### **Step 2 – Short Social Profile (Required for Activities)**

* Key personal details (name, age, gender, location, photo).
* Brief personal intro and relationship intent.
* At least one verified social connection (Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn).
* Purpose: Ensure credibility and context so they can participate in group activities, discussions, or events without full verification.

---

#### **Step 3 – Comprehensive Profile (Required for Verification & Subscription)**

* Full background details: education, occupation, lifestyle choices, partner preferences, values, and interests.
* Additional photos and a more detailed bio.
* All responses are reviewed for authenticity and quality.
* Purpose: Establish a complete identity, increase trust, and enable verification.

---

#### **Step 4 – Verification**

* Social verification (preferred) or manual review process.
* Only verified users are eligible for subscriptions.
* Purpose: Maintain a safe, authentic member base.

---

#### **Step 5 – Subscription Gating for Introductions**

* Verified users can purchase a subscription.
* Only subscribed, verified users may request or receive direct introductions.
* Purpose: Create commitment, prevent casual misuse, and fund the quality-matching process.

---

#### **Step 6 – First Participation**

* After completing the short social profile, the user can:

  * Join group activities or discussions.
  * Receive daily/weekly prompts for engagement.
* Once verified and subscribed, they can:

  * Request personalised introductions.
  * Access premium events or curated matchmaking features.
* Purpose: Build early engagement while nudging toward verification and subscription.

---

### **Why This Matters**

* **Safety**: Ensures only genuine, committed individuals can interact meaningfully.
* **Quality**: The short social profile filters out unserious participants before they enter group spaces.
* **Trust**: The comprehensive profile and verification build credibility and foster respectful interactions.
* **Revenue & Sustainability**: Subscription gating for introductions ensures a committed pool of participants and supports the operational model.
* **Scalability**: App IDs and clear participation thresholds make it easy to manage user progression across different stages of the service.

Match Colab – Build Brief: User Engagement Design
Goal

To create a community-first networking platform where people form meaningful connections through structured prompts, group participation, and direct introductions. Engagement should feel natural, rewarding, and progressively more personal.
Engagement Philosophy

We want people to:

    Enter easily – no overwhelming onboarding, instant low-barrier participation.

    Stay curious – fresh, daily micro-interactions that nudge exploration.

    Invest personally – as they connect with others, they share more and engage more.

    Progress naturally – move from public/group interactions to private introductions.

    Feel rewarded – through visibility, responses, and tangible steps toward their goal (friendship or relationship).

Engagement Loops
1. Daily Prompt Loop

    Trigger: Admin posts a daily activity (question, real-life situation, poll).

    Action: Members respond to the prompt.

    Social Feedback: Others react (like, thoughtful reaction) or comment on responses.

    Progress: Interesting exchanges can be turned into introduction requests by subscribed members.

    Retention: Members return daily to see the next prompt and check new reactions.

2. Member-Led Interaction Loop

    Trigger: Members can post their own question or scenario (moderated before going live).

    Action: The community responds.

    Social Feedback: Poster receives comments and reactions, creating a sense of visibility and validation.

    Progress: Engaging posts can make a member more visible to others, improving match opportunities.

3. Group Discovery Loop

    Trigger: Members join groups based on age, interest, or criteria (e.g., Singles 40+, Spiritual, Working Professionals).

    Action: Participate in group-exclusive prompts or discussions.

    Social Feedback: Familiarity builds within smaller circles, encouraging repeat interactions.

    Progress: Members are more likely to request introductions within familiar groups.

4. Real-Time Connection Loop

    Trigger: Display of "X users online" encourages spontaneous activity.

    Action: Respond to prompts or react to posts knowing others are active now.

    Social Feedback: Immediate reactions or replies reinforce the feeling of presence.

    Progress: Encourages micro-bursts of engagement during free moments.

5. Introduction Loop (Premium Feature)

    Trigger: User finds someone interesting via responses or groups.

    Action: Subscribed members request an introduction.

    Social Feedback: The introduction is facilitated with a warm, context-rich message.

    Progress: Leads to private conversations, deeper engagement, and possible matches.

Friction Reduction & Motivation

    Identity Verification: Link at least one of Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn to improve trust and credibility.

    Visible Context: Always show age, gender, and marital status for singles-seeking-life-partners.

    Low Commitment Entry: Users can react or vote without having to post right away.

    Safe Space Assurance: Clear moderation guidelines and visible admin activity.

Progression Mechanics

    Phase 1: Anonymous browsing & light reactions (low pressure).

    Phase 2: Regular responses to daily prompts.

    Phase 3: Joining interest-based groups for focused interaction.

    Phase 4: Sending and receiving introductions.

    Phase 5: Forming consistent personal connections.

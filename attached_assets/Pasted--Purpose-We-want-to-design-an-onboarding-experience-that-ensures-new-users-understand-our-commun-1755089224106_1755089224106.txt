### Purpose

We want to design an onboarding experience that ensures new users understand our community, feel safe, and are guided toward creating a meaningful profile that allows them to participate in activities, become verified, and, if they wish, purchase a subscription for introductions. This flow must balance ease of entry with enough information to ensure quality and trust within the platform.

### **Core Principles**

1. **Safety & Trust** – We onboard only real people who are serious about finding a life partner.
2. **Progressive Commitment** – Reduce friction at signup, but encourage deeper profile completion before unlocking key features.
3. **Transparency** – Clearly explain what each step is for and how their information is used.
4. **Participation Gating** – Users must complete a *short social profile* to join activities, a *comprehensive profile* for verification and subscription eligibility, and hold a paid subscription to request introductions.
5. **Unique Identification** – No pseudonyms; each account is auto assigned a unique slug (6 chars). We show it to users as **App ID**. This will show up in their interactions - gender/age/slug something like M/25/abcd12

### **Onboarding Journey**

#### **Step 1 – Minimal Account Setup**

* User provides essential contact details (email or phone) and verifies via OTP.
* Consent is collected for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines.
* The system assigns the user a **unique App ID** for internal and community identification.
* Purpose: Quickly create a secure account and start tracking the onboarding journey.

---

#### **Step 2 – Short Social Profile (Required for Activities)**

* Key personal details (name, age, gender, residential city).
* Brief personal intro and marital status (single never married, divorced, separated (filed for divorce), separated (divorce not filed), married)
* At least one verified social connection (Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn).
* Purpose: Ensure credibility and context so they can participate in group activities, discussions, or events without full verification.

---

#### **Step 3 – Full Profile (Required for Subscription and Verification)**

* Full background details: education, occupation, lifestyle choices, partner preferences, values, and interests.
* Additional photos and a more detailed bio.
* All responses are reviewed for authenticity and quality.
* Purpose: Establish a complete identity, increase trust, and enable verification.

Basic Profile: verification status, profile status (admin only); first/middle/last name, gender, DOB, height, marital status, children, faith, country/state/city/location, nationality, email, country code & mobile numbers
Lifestyle & Habits:  Smoking, drinking, diet, workout, interests (rich text), ID document & number, languages spoken, LinkedIn/Instagram/Facebook links
Professional Details:  Educational qualification, degree details, institution, professional introduction, industry sector, currency, income range
Match Preferences: Age range, height range, smoking/drinking preferences, faith preferences, marital‑status preferences, willingness for single parent/relocation, additional preferences, profile visibility & public‑profile field toggles
About Me:  Bio, family details, health concerns, photo uploads (up to five images)

these are the fields and soft grouping for reference. how we actually group and implement them is whatever approach is best as per the theme and flow of the app

---

#### **Step 4 – Verification**

* Social verification (preferred) or manual review process.
* Only verified users are eligible for subscriptions.
* Purpose: Maintain a safe, authentic member base.

---

#### **Step 5 – Subscription Gating for Introductions**

* Users need to purchase subscription and get verified over a 1-1 call producing their ID cards for verification during the call
* Only subscribed, verified users may request or receive direct introductions.
* Purpose: Create commitment, prevent casual misuse and fund the quality-matching process.

---

#### **Step 6 – First Participation**

* After completing the short social profile, the user can:

  * Join group activities or discussions.
  * Receive daily/weekly prompts for engagement.
* Once verified and subscribed, they can:

  * Request personalised introductions.
  * Access premium events or curated matchmaking features.
* Purpose: Build early engagement while nudging toward verification and subscription.

---

### **Why This Matters**

* **Safety**: Ensures only genuine, committed individuals can interact meaningfully.
* **Quality**: The short social profile filters out unserious participants before they enter group spaces.
* **Trust**: The comprehensive profile and verification build credibility and foster respectful interactions.
* **Revenue & Sustainability**: Subscription gating for introductions ensures a committed pool of participants and supports the operational model.
* **Scalability**: App IDs and clear participation thresholds make it easy to manage user progression across different stages of the service.
